# MotifFinding-Bio-Informatics-problem
Bio-Informatics problem  , The Motif Finding problem given a set of DNA sequences detecting overrepresented motifs .
Compute the scores for each possible combination of starting positions s
The best score will determine the best profile and the consensus pattern in DNA
The goal is to maximize Score(s,DNA) by varying the starting positions si
t  -   number of sample DNA sequences
n  -   length of each DNA sequence
DNA - sample of DNA sequences (t x n array)

l  -   length of the motif
